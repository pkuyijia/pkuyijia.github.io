I'm an avid fan of various board games and chess. My BGA account is *jyi2002*, and I'm always happy to connect and play together! I also enjoy playing poker and have participated in several tournaments, with my best achievement being 1st place out of over 150 participants in 2022. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Shuang Sheng and Mahjong.

In my spare time, I love playing sports such as badminton and tennis. I also enjoy listening to music and singing.
