Hi there! I'm Jia Yi, a senior student at the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics.

I have a broad interest in Statistics, Machine Learning, and Quantitative Finance. My participation in several mathematical competitions during high school has provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics. I have interned at Jane Street as a Quant Trader and at Citadel Securities as a Quant Researcher. Additionally, I conducted research on mutual fund market efficiency in China using machine learning methods, under the guidance of Prof. [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun%20/index.html). In the Spring of 2023, I also had the opportunity to visit Harvard College.

For more information, you can check out my [CV](https://pkuyijia.github.io/files/Jia.pdf) (last updated: July 2024) and my [Awards](https://pkuyijia.github.io/awards/).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!
